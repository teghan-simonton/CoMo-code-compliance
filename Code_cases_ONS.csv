The tenants have been stacking up trash the last several weeks at the west side of the porch at 1414 Rosemary Lane.  Aside from that being an ordinance violation they aren't placing the garbage at the curb for regular pickup on Monday.

I've noticed several other buildings doing the same thing. Some get the trash to the curb on Monday for pickup. Some don't sometimes.

There is also a large brush pile in between 1414 and 1416 Rosemary Lane that has been there for a least a few weeks.

I know these aren't the most pressing problems but it seems, especially with the trash stacking outside of buildings, it gives the impression to other residents that it is OK to do this.

Subject: [Waste-Mgmt]: Would Someone Please Call Me About TOE @ 1504 Rosemary Lane
To: waste-mgmt@gocolumbiamo.com <waste-mgmt@gocolumbiamo.com>, Glen McDonald <waste-mgmt@como.gov>


I have been reporting TOE at 1504 Rosemary Lane on a weekly basis for about the last month and a half. Such was the case earlier this week with TOE @ 1504. I believe or assume you folks picked it up sometime Wednesday morning, 10/31/18. I say that because when I came home for lunch around 1200 there was no trash at the curb in front of 1504.

THEN, when I came home from work later that day at about 5:30 p.m. there was trash set out at the curb at 1504. I cannot fathom why this problem with TOE at 1504 has not been rectified. Is this residence being fined? Has the landlord/property owner been notified?

Rosemary Lane continues to improve overall in many aspects but you have these imbeciles at 1504 who don't know how to properly set out trash. Something is wrong here.

I would appreciate a call at your convenience.

Thank you for all the great work Solid Waste does! Believe me, I'm on your side!

It was needing to be mowed last week but I don't believe it was at a level that needs your attention.  The owner's just want to fight about it all.  

I received an email from the Housing Authority that the tenant hires someone to mow regularly.  The small privacy fences behind the 1405-07 are a wreck and they have been storing trash back there.  I am told that they will purchase trash cans so I will wait and see if that occurs.

If you find yourself over this way, the house on the southwest corner of Rosemary and William has a busted up couch that has been setting in the front yard for a while.

Also, yes, 1504 Rosemary Lane has trash out early again. I contacted Solid Waste AGAIN. Somebody's butt needs to get a summons at 1504.

There was a call from a man who stated this property appeared to be abandoned for a while, and now someone is living there.  He said that he doesn't think it has been inspected, and questions if it is safe.  He did not say why he thought it was unsafe, except for the fact that it was ""abandoned"" for a while.  I checked records, and it was sold be in 2016.  It has a current rental certificate as well.  Caller id shows the number the man was calling from was 573-228-6658.

to me

Hi Marsha,

Can you assist me with a vehicle at 2417 Calder Ct?  He has a red Dodge truck in the driveway with expired plates.  He continues to move it from the private parking lot, where I will tow it next time, to his driveway.  This has been a constant battle as he also parks his large trailers with mowers in the street which sometimes hinders traffic.   The landlord does not respond to any requests.  Sadly, it appears to be a business truck.

Any assistance would be greatly appreciated."

Hi Lisa,
I had the homeowner at 1118 Club Meadows Dr. call in a complaint about her neighbors trees to the south. Apparently, several of the cedars were damaged in the snow storm. I haven't had time to look at it yet but thought I would ask if this is something you all would handle (see below).
Thanks,
Steve Fritz

I?ll call her next week. This is commercial property so I need to find out if BSD or ONS handles this type of complaint.  

FYI. If fallen branches from a weather event falls on someone property it is the responsibility of each property owner to handle. 

I?m on my way there now.   Thank you for the number and name. 

Lisa.

Hello. The house on the corner of East walnut and Calvin drive continues to have trash out.
There was a shopping cart in front yard for weeks, which they moved to another neighbor?s yard on Calvin.

Can anything be done to fix this on-going issue?

to Leigh, nate, John

Leign,
Attached are some pictures at an apartment building at 3408 Balboa.  There is severe deterioration on the balconies.  WIthout coverings being removed it is hard to say how extensive the deterioration is.  Nate Lindsey with Modern Property was on site.  I instructed him that these balconies need to be addressed immediately.  Once some coverings are removed they may even need a structural analysis, closed off for use, and a structural repair pending the amount of damage in which case would require a permit.  I wanted to get this to you so you can have your ONS could follow through ASAP.  Let me know if you have any questions.
Thanks
Daryl Brown

COLUMBIA, MO 65201",7/12/2022,ONS - Zoning Violation - Occupancy,7/12/2022,Sixth,Closed,"Dear Leigh and Marsha,
On our dog walk last weekend, we met Samuel, a new resident of 606. He reported that he has four other housemates and when they moved in this summer, everything was trashed ?like there had been a big party?. One garage door is broken, the back door is dysfunctional and there are broken windows in the back.
Who is responsible to make sure the house is ready for new tenants? Who is responsible for the ongoing violation of occupancy laws?

The first picture shows the mostly dead trees overgrown with vines in the front yard:




The exterior of 606 William continues to deteriorate as vegetation engulfs the white picket fence. You can see in this picture that the gate no longer closes and the white picket fence is so overgrown that it is barely visible:



Thank you for asking that the weeds be cleared from in front of the ?no parking here to corner sign?. Weeds are once again engulfing the sign as you can see:



The fourth picture shows the chimney and south side of the home with vines growing rampant. As you know, vines deteriorate the mortar of the structure:



This picture shows 606 in winter before the current owner bought the property and set it on a course of entropy:


Also mayor and councilperson, I would welcome your thoughts about what can legally be done. As you know in East campus there are some wonderfully diligent landlords. This landlord is a black eye on East campus and in particular our block. This landlord is disrespecting the interior and exterior of the property, his tenants and the East Campus neighborhood. Please help enforce our laws and bring back this property from the brink of destruction.
Thank you,
Ann and David Mehr

Issue: Residential Maintenance
Observation Date: 2022-07-24
Address/Intersection: 3640 Evergreen Ln
Description of issue or damage: The property at 3640 Evergreen ln is vacant and overgrown. This includes 6-10 ft high weeds, logs from a fallen trees. The tree limbs and weeds are starting to grow into my property. They mow the very tiny front yard but haven't touched the backyard in years. This cannot be fixed with a lawnmower. It would take a crew of men with chainsaws, brushogs and many truckloads of waste removal. I've been staring at this eyesore from my back deck for a few years. Can you please check this out and have the property owner get this taken care of? The neighborhood wood appreciate it. Thank you, John Dominique Source: Tyler 311 Request Number: ONSVEG-817, Request ID: 137220."

Columbia, MO 65201",8/22/2022,ONS - Rental Complaint Violation,9/12/2022,First,Resolved,"I moved my 19 y.o. son on 8/15/22 into an apartment that I rented at 400 s Ninth st in Columbia. A bat was in the kitchen that day on a high kitchen cupboard and there were droppings in the kitchen. The landord sent someone to remove the bat (released it out a window).  I then notified the landlord in writing that there is evidence of  a bat infestation in that there are multiple droppings in the back stairwell on the walls and floor. 
Landlord replied on 8/17 that he would look into it. Nothing more. 
How long before I can do something more to enforce this health issue? Currently we do not feel it is sanitary to exit the rear staircase which risks contact with a bat or its feces. There is also mold on one wall of front stairwell that he did not respond to me about. 
Thank you.
